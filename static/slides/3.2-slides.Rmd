.pull-left[
- Statistics profession is obstinant that we cannot say anything about causality
  - Statisticians: causation is simply a subset of correlation, where correlation is $-1$ or $1$

- But you have to! It's how the human brain works!

- We can't concieve of (spurious) correlation without some causation

]

# Counterfactuals

- The *sine qua non* of causal claims are .shout[counterfactuals]: what would $Y$ have been if $X$ had been different?
- It is **impossible** to make a counterfactual claim from data alone! Need a causal model of the data-generating process!

---

# Counterfactuals and RCTs

- Again, RCTs are invoked as the gold standard for their ability to make counterfactual claims:
- Treatment/intervention $(X)$ is *randomly assigned* to individuals, and then outcome $Y$ is measured

> If person i who recieved treatment *had not recieved* the treatment, we can predict what his outcome *would have been*

> If person j who did not recieve treatment *had recieved treatment*, we can predict what her outcome *would have been*

- We can say this because, on average, treatment and control groups are *the same before treatment*

# From RCTs to Causal Models

- RCTs are but the best-known method of a large, growing science of .shout[causal inference]
- We need a .shout[causal model] to describe the .shout[data-generating process (DGP)]
- Requires us to make some .whisper[assumptions]

# Drawing a DAG:

1. Consider all the variables likely to be important to the data-generating process (including variables we can't observe!)

2. For simplicity, combine some similar ones together or prune those that aren't very important

3. Consider which variables are likely to affect others, and draw arrows connecting them

4. Test some testable implications of the model (to see if we have a correct one!)

# Side Notes

.pull-left[

- Drawing an arrow requires a direction - making a statement about causality!

- *Omitting* an arrow makes an equally important statement too!
  - In fact, we will *need* omitted arrows to show causality!

- If two variables are correlated, but neither causes the other, it's likely they are both caused by another (perhaps unobserved) variable - add it!

- There should be no *cycles* or *loops* (if so, there's probably another missing variable, such as time)

- Tells you **how to identify your effect**! (upper right)

> Minimal sufficient adjustment sets containing background, location, year for estimating the total effect of educ on wage:
background, location, year

- Tells you **some testable implications** (middle right)
  - *conditional independencies*, take the last one:
  - `job_connections` $\perp$ `year` | `educ`
  - means: holding constant `educ`, there should be no correlation between `job_connections` and `year` - can test this with data!

]

---

# Implications

- In order to .onfire[identify] the effect of education on wages, our model implies we need to control for background, location, and year
  - note: we do *not* need to control for anything else!

--

- How to control for them?
  - many ways, we've learned one: multivariate regression:
  
--

$$wages=\beta_0+\beta_1 \, educ + \beta_2 \, background + \beta_3 \, location + \beta_4 \, year$$

--

- How did Dagitty know what we needed to do? Some simple rules (below)
