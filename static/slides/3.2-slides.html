# Causal Inference

.pull-left[

- We will seek to understand what causality *is* and how we can approach finding it

- We will also explore the different common .hi[research designs] meant to .hi-purple[identify] causal relationships

- **These skills**, more than supply &amp; demand, constrained optimization models, ISLM, etc, **are the tools and comparative advantage of a modern research economist**
    - Why all big companies (especially in tech) have entire economics departments in them

.content-box-green[

- Flipping the switch `\((X)\)` causes the light to go on `\((Y)\)`

# Non-Causal Claims 

- All of the following have non-zero correlations. Are they *causal*?

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]

- Greater ice cream sales `\(\rightarrow\)` more violent crime
- Rooster crows `\(\rightarrow\)` the sun rises in the morning
- Taking Vitamin C `\(\rightarrow\)` Colds go away a few days later
- Political party in power `\(\rightarrow\)` economy performs better or worse
]

# Counterfactuals

.pull-left[

- The *sine qua non* of causal claims are .hi[counterfactuals]: what would `\(Y\)` have been if `\(X\)` had been different?

- It is **impossible** to make a counterfactual claim from data alone! 

- Need a (theoretical) .hi-purpl[causal model] of the data-generating process!

# Counterfactuals and RCTs

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Again, RCTs are invoked as the gold standard for their ability to make counterfactual claims:

- Treatment/intervention `\((X)\)` is *randomly assigned* to individuals, and then outcome `\(Y\)` is measured

&gt; If person i who recieved treatment *had not recieved* the treatment, we can predict what his outcome *would have been*

&gt; If person j who did not recieve treatment *had recieved treatment*, we can predict what her outcome *would have been*

- We can say this because, on average, treatment and control groups are *the same before treatment*

# Causal Diagrams

# Causal Diagrams/DAGs

.pull-left[
- A surprisingly simple, yet rigorous and powerful method of modeling is using a .hi[causal diagram] or .hi[DAG]:
  - .hi[Directed]: Each node has arrows that points only one direction
  - .hi[Acyclic]: Arrows only have one direction, and cannot loop back

# Drawing a DAG: Example

- Suppose we have data on three variables
  - `IP`: how much a firm spends on IP lawsuits 
  - `tech`: whether a firm is in tech industry
  - `profit`: firm profits

- They are all correlated with each other, but what's are the causal relationships? 

- We need our own .hi-purple[causal model] (from theory, intuition, etc) to sort
  - Data alone will not tell us!

# Drawing a DAG: 

.pull-left[

1. Consider all the variables likely to be important to the data-generating process (including variables we can't observe!)

2. For simplicity, combine some similar ones together or prune those that aren't very important

3. Consider which variables are likely to affect others, and draw arrows connecting them

4. Test some testable implications of the model (to see if we have a correct one!)

# Side Notes

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Drawing an arrow requires a direction - making a statement about causality!

- *Omitting* an arrow makes an equally important statement too!
  - In fact, we will *need* omitted arrows to show causality!

- If two variables are correlated, but neither causes the other, likely they are both caused by another (perhaps **unobserved**) variable - add it!

- There should be no *cycles* or *loops* (if so, there’s probably another missing variable, such as time)

# DAG Example IV

.pull-left[

- This is messy, but we have a causal model!

- Makes our assumptions **explicit**, and many of them are **testable**

- DAG suggests certain relationships that will *not* exist:
  - all relationships between `laws` and `conx` go through `educ`
  - so if we controlled for `educ`, then `cor(laws,conx)` should be zero!

# Confounders

.pull-left[

- Confounders are the DAG-equivalent of .hi[omitted variable bias] (next class)

`$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_i$$`

- By leaving out `\(Z_i\)`, this regression is .hi-purple[biased]

- `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` picks up *both*:
  - `\(X \rightarrow Y\)`
  - `\(X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y\)`

# Controlling I 

.pull-left[

- Ideally, if we ran a .hi[randomized control trial] and randomily assigned different values of `\(X\)` to different individuals, this would delete the arrow between `\(Z\)` and `\(X\)`
  - Individuals’ values of `\(Z\)` do not affect whether or not they are treated ($X$)

- This would only leave the front-door, `\(X \rightarrow Y\)`

# Summary: DAG Rules for Causal Identification

.pull-left[
.smallest[
Thus, to achieve .hi-purple[causal identification], control for the minimal amount of variables such that:

1. Ensure **no back-door path remains open**
  - Close back-door paths by *controlling* for any one variable along that path
  - Colliders along a path *automatically* close that path

2. Ensure **no front-door path is closed**
  - Do not control for mediators
