# The Causal Revolution

.pull-left[
- Statistics profession is obstinant that we cannot say anything about causality
  - Statisticians: causation is simply a subset of correlation, where correlation is `\(-1\)` or `\(1\)`

- But you have to! It's how the human brain works!

- We can't concieve of (spurious) correlation without some causation

# Causal Inference

.pull-left[

- **These skills**, more than supply &amp; demand, constrained optimization models, ISLM, etc, **are the tools and comparative advantage of a modern research economist**

# Less-Clear Causal Claims

- Tariffs reduce the volume of international trade

# Non-Causal Claims 

- All of the following have non-zero correlations. Are they causal?

- Greater ice cream sales cause more violent crime
- Rooster crows cause the sun to rise in the morning

- Less clear: 

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]

- Colds tend to clear up a few days after you take Vitamin-C
- The economy performs better or worse depending on the political party in power

]

---

# Counterfactuals

- The *sine qua non* of causal claims are .shout[counterfactuals]: what would `\(Y\)` have been if `\(X\)` had been different?
- It is **impossible** to make a counterfactual claim from data alone! Need a causal model of the data-generating process!

---

# Counterfactuals and RCTs

- Again, RCTs are invoked as the gold standard for their ability to make counterfactual claims:
- Treatment/intervention `\((X)\)` is *randomly assigned* to individuals, and then outcome `\(Y\)` is measured

&gt; If person i who recieved treatment *had not recieved* the treatment, we can predict what his outcome *would have been*

&gt; If person j who did not recieve treatment *had recieved treatment*, we can predict what her outcome *would have been*

- We can say this because, on average, treatment and control groups are *the same before treatment*

---

# From RCTs to Causal Models

- RCTs are but the best-known method of a large, growing science of .shout[causal inference]
- We need a .shout[causal model] to describe the .shout[data-generating process (DGP)]
- Requires us to make some .whisper[assumptions]

# Drawing a DAG

- Causal diagram (DAG) is the *model* of what you think the data-generating process is

- Useful to help figure out how to *identify* particular relationships of interest

- Requires some common sense/economic intutition

- Remember, all models are wrong, we just need them to be *useful*!

---

# Drawing a DAG: Example

.pull-left[

- Suppose we have data on three variables
  - `IP`: how much a firm spends on IP lawsuits 
  - `tech`: whether a firm is in tech industry
  - `profit`: firm profits

- They are all correlated with each other, but what's are the causal relationships? 

- We need our own **causal model** (from theory, intuition, etc) to sort
  - Data alone will not tell us!

# Drawing a DAG: 

.pull-left[

1. Consider all the variables likely to be important to the data-generating process (including variables we can't observe!)

2. For simplicity, combine some similar ones together or prune those that aren't very important

3. Consider which variables are likely to affect others, and draw arrows connecting them

4. Test some testable implications of the model (to see if we have a correct one!)

# Side Notes

.pull-left[

- Drawing an arrow requires a direction - making a statement about causality!

- *Omitting* an arrow makes an equally important statement too!
  - In fact, we will *need* omitted arrows to show causality!

- If two variables are correlated, but neither causes the other, it's likely they are both caused by another (perhaps unobserved) variable - add it!

- There should be no *cycles* or *loops* (if so, there's probably another missing variable, such as time)

# DAG Example IV

.pull-left[

- This is messy, but we have a causal model!

- Makes our assumptions **explicit**, and many of them are **testable**

- DAG suggests certain relationships that will *not* exist:
  - all relationships between `laws` and `conx` go through `educ`
  - so if we controlled for `educ`, then `cor(laws,conx)` should be zero!

- Tells you **how to identify your effect**! (upper right)

&gt; Minimal sufficient adjustment sets containing background, location, year for estimating the total effect of educ on wage:
background, location, year

- Tells you **some testable implications** (middle right)
  - *conditional independencies*, take the last one:
  - `job_connections` `\(\perp\)` `year` | `educ`
  - means: holding constant `educ`, there should be no correlation between `job_connections` and `year` - can test this with data!

]

---

# Implications

- In order to .onfire[identify] the effect of education on wages, our model implies we need to control for background, location, and year
  - note: we do *not* need to control for anything else!

--

- How to control for them?
  - many ways, we've learned one: multivariate regression:
  
--

`$$wages=\beta_0+\beta_1 \, educ + \beta_2 \, background + \beta_3 \, location + \beta_4 \, year$$`

--

- How did Dagitty know what we needed to do? Some simple rules (below)

# Front Doors and Back Doors

.pull-left[

- With this graph, there are two paths that connect `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

1. A .shout[causal "front-door" path] `\(X \rightarrow Y\)`
    - Good, what we want to measure
    
2. A .shout[non-causal "back-door" path] `\(X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y\)`
    - At least one causal arrow runs in the opposite direction
    - Bad, adds a confounding bias

# Controlling I 

.pull-left[

- If we can .onfire[control for] `\(Z\)`, we can *block* the back-door path `\(X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y\)`
    - Essentially, delete the arrow(s) connecting `\(X\)`, `\(Z\)`, and `\(Y\)`

- This would only leave the front-door, `\(X \rightarrow Y\)`

# Controlling II 

.pull-left[

- How to "control for" `\(Z\)`? We want to remove its influence over determining the values of `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`

- Multiple methods exist, but we've done this with .shout[multivariate regression]

- At the simplest level, consider only looking at values of `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` for all observations that have the *same* value of `\(Z\)`
  - removes causal influence `\(Z\)` has on `\(X\)` and on `\(Y\)`
  - leaves only the influence `\(X\)` has on `\(Y\)`!

# Controlling III

.pull-left[

- Controlling for a single variable along a long causal path is sufficient to block that path!

- Causal path: `\(X \rightarrow Y\)`
- Backdoor path: `\(X \leftarrow A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow Y\)`

- It is sufficient to block this backdoor by controlling **either** `\(A\)` **or** `\(B\)` **or** `\(C\)`!

# The Back Door Criterion

.pull-left[

# The Back Door Criterion

.pull-left[

- Implications of the Back-door criterion:

1. You *only* need to control for the variables that keep a back-door open, *not all other variables!*

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]:

- `\(X \rightarrow Y\)` (front-door)
- `\(X \leftarrow A \rightarrow B \rightarrow Y\)` (back-door)

- Need only control for `\(A\)` *or* `\(B\)` to block the one back-door path
- `\(Z\)` has no effect on `\(X\)`, and therefore we don't need to control for it!

# The Back Door Criterion: Colliders

.pull-left[

- A case where controlling for a variable actually *adds bias* is if that variable is known as a .shout["collider"].

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]:

- `\(X \rightarrow Y\)` (front-door)
- `\(X \leftarrow A \rightarrow B \leftarrow C \rightarrow Y\)` (back-door, but **blocked by collider!**)

- `\(B\)` is a collider because both `\(A\)` and `\(C\)` point to it
] 

- A collider automatically *blocks* a path
- If you control for the collider, it *opens* a path (bad idea if it's a backdoor path)

- Knowing `\(Flu\)` doesn't tell us about `\(Bus\)` (no arrow)

- Conditional on being in `\(Hos\)`, negative association between `\(Flu\)` and `\(Bus\)` (spurious!)

# Collider Example: Gender Discrimination I

.pull-left[

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]: How much of wage disparities are caused by gender-based discrimination?

1. `\(discr \rightarrow wage\)` (Causal path)
2. `\(discr \rightarrow occup \rightarrow wage\)` (Causal path)
3. `\(discr \leftarrow gender \rightarrow occup \rightarrow wage\)` (BLOCKED back door!)
4. `\(discr \leftarrow gender \rightarrow occup \leftarrow abil \rightarrow wage\)` (BLOCKED back door!)
5. `\(discr \rightarrow occup \leftarrow abil \rightarrow wage\)` (BLOCKED back door!)

- Should we control for `occup`?

# Collider Example: Gender Discrimination II

.pull-left[

- If we *control* for occupation:
  - opens backdoor paths 3, 4, 5!
  - creates spurious `cor(abil,discr)` where there wasn't one!
  - also closes causal path 2! (discriminatory reasons genders choose different occupations)
  
- **Can't identify causal effect** controlling for `occup` alone!
  - *Could* if you could control for `occup` *and* `abil` (but perhaps `abil` is unobserved)

- `\(X \leftarrow A \rightarrow Y\)` (back-door)

# The Front Door Criterion: Mediators III

.pull-left[

- Tobacco industry claimed that `\(cor(smoking, cancer)\)` could be spurious due to a confounding `gene` that affects both!
  - Smoking `gene` is unobservable

- Suppose smoking causes `tar` buildup in lungs, which cause `cancer`

- We should *not* control for `tar`, it's on the **front-door path**
  - This is how scientific studies can relate smoking to cancer

# Recap

.pull-left[

Thus, to achieve .onfire[causal identification], control for the minimal amount of variables such that:

1. Ensure that **no back-door path remains open**
    - Close back-door paths by *controlling* for any variable along that path
    - Colliders along a path *automatically* close that path

2. Ensure that **no front-door path is closed**
