# Goodness of Fit

- How well does a line fit data? How tightly clustered around the line are the data points?

- Quantify .hi-purple[how much variation in `\\(Y_i\\)` is "explained" by the model]

--

$$\underbrace{Y_i}_{Observed}=\underbrace{\widehat{Y_i}}_{Model}+\underbrace{\hat{u}}_{Error}$$


- Recall OLS estimators chosen to minimize .hi[Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)]: $\left(\displaystyle \sum^n_{i=1}\hat{u_i}^2\right)$

---

# Goodness of Fit: $R^2$

- Primary measure<sup>.magenta[†]</sup> is .hi[regression R-squared], the fraction of variation in $Y$ explained by variation in predicted values $(\hat{Y})$

$$R^2 = \frac{var(\widehat{Y_i})}{var(Y_i)}$$

# Goodness of Fit: $R^2$ Formula II

- Equivalently, the complement of the fraction of *unexplained* variation in $Y_i$ 

$$R^2=1-\frac{SSE}{TSS}$$

- Equivalently, the square of the correlation coefficient between $X$ and $Y$: 

--

$$R^2=(r_{X,Y})^2$$

# Calculating $R^2$ in R I

```{r, echo=T}
# as squared correlation coefficient

# Base R
cor(CASchool$testscr, CASchool$str)^2

# dplyr
CASchool %>%
  summarize(r_sq = cor(testscr,str)^2)
```

---

# Calculating $R^2$ in R II

- Recall `broom`'s `augment()` command makes a lot of new regression-based values like:
    - `.fitted`: predicted values $(\hat{Y_i})$
    - `.resid`: residuals $(\hat{u_i})$
    
```{r, echo=T}
library(broom)
school_reg %>%
  augment() %>%
  head(., n=5) # show first 5 values
```

---

# Calculating $R^2$ in R III

- We can calculate `R` as the ratio of variances in model vs. actual (i.e. akin to $\frac{ESS}{TSS}$)

.code60[
```{r, echo = T}
# as ratio of variances
school_reg %>%
  augment() %>%
  summarize(r_sq = var(.fitted)/var(testscr)) # var. of *predicted* testscr over var. of *actual* testscr
```
]

---

# Goodness of Fit: Standard Error of the Regression

- .hi[Standard Error of the Regression], $\hat{\sigma}$ or $\hat{\sigma}_{u}$ is an estimator of the standard deviation of $u_i$

--

$$\hat{\sigma_u}=\sqrt{\frac{SSE}{n-2}}$$

--

- Measures the .hi-purple[average size of the residuals] (distances between data points and the regression line)
  - An average prediction error of the line
  - .hi-turquoise[Degrees of Freedom correction] of $n-2$: we use up 2 df to first calculate $\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$!

# Recall: The Two Big Problems with Data

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- We use econometrics to .hi-purple[identify] causal relationships and make .hi-purple[inferences] about them

1. Problem for .hi-purple[identification]: .hi[endogeneity]
    - $X$ is **exogenous** if its variation is *unrelated* to other factors $(u)$ that affect $Y$
    - $X$ is **endogenous** if its variation is *related* to other factors $(u)$ that affect $Y$

2. Problem for .hi-purple[inference]: .hi[randomness]
    - Data is random due to **natural sampling variation**
    - Taking one sample of a population will yield slightly different information than another sample of the same population

# Distributions of the OLS Estimators

- OLS estimators $(\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1})$ are computed from a finite (specific) sample of data

- Our OLS model contains **2 sources of randomness**:

--

- .hi-purple[*Modeled* randomness]: $u$ includes all factors affecting $Y$ *other* than $X$
    - different samples will have different values of those other factors $(u_i)$

--

- .hi-purple[*Sampling* randomness]: different samples will generate different OLS estimators
    - Thus, $\hat{\beta_0}, \hat{\beta_1}$ are *also* **random variables**, with their own <span class=hi>sampling distribution</span>

# Sampling Basics

]

.smaller[
- 5.4 hours is a .hi-purple[sample statistic] describing the sample; we are more interested in the corresponding .hi-turquoise[parameter] of the relevant population (e.g. all Americans)
]

.smaller[
- If we take another sample of 100 people, would we get the same number?
]
--

.smaller[
- Roughly, but probably not exactly

- .hi[Sampling variability] describes the effect of a statistic varying somewhat from sample to sample
  - This is *normal*, not the result of any error or bias!
]
---

# I.I.D. Samples

.pull-left[

- If we collect many samples, and each sample is randomly drawn from the population (and then replaced), then the distribution of samples is said to be .hi-purple[independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)]

- Each sample is **independent** of each other sample (due to replacement)

- Each sample comes from the **identical** underlying population distribution

# The Sampling Distribution of OLS Estimators

.pull-left[
- Calculating OLS estimators for a sample makes the OLS estimators *themselves* random variables:

- Draw of $i$ is random $\implies$ value of each $(X_i,Y_i)$ is random $\implies$ $\hat{\beta_0},\hat{\beta_1}$ are random

- Taking different samples will create different values of $\hat{\beta_0},\hat{\beta_1}$

- Therefore, $\hat{\beta_0},\hat{\beta_1}$ each have a .hi[sampling distribution] across different samples

# The Central Limit Theorem

- .hi[Central Limit Theorem (CLT)]: if we collect samples of size $n$ from the same population and generate a sample statistic (e.g. OLS estimator), then with large enough $n$, the distribution of the sample statistic is approximately normal IF 
    1. $n \geq 30$
    2. Samples come from a *known* normal distribution $\sim N(\mu,\sigma)$

--

- If neither of these are true, we have other methods (coming shortly!) 

- One of the most fundamental principles in all of statistics

- Allows for virtually all testing of statistical hypotheses $\rightarrow$ estimating probabilities of values on a normal distribution

---

# The Sampling Distribution of $\hat{\beta_1}$ I

.pull-left[

- The CLT allows us to approximate the sampling distributions of $\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$ as normal

- We care about $\hat{\beta_1}$ (slope) since it has economic meaning, rarely about $\hat{\beta_0}$ (intercept)

$$\hat{\beta_1} \sim N(E[\hat{\beta_1}], \sigma_{\hat{\beta_1}})$$

# Exogeneity and Unbiasedness

- $\hat{\beta_1}$ is .hi-purple[unbiased] iff there is no systematic difference, on average, between sample values of $\hat{\beta_1}$ and .hi-turquoise[true population parameter] $\beta_1$, i.e.

$$E[\hat{\beta_1}]=\beta_1$$

--

- Does *not* mean any sample gives us $\hat{\beta_1}=\beta_1$, only the .hi-purple[estimation procedure] will, *on average*, yield the correct value

- Random errors above and below the true value cancel out (so that on average, $E[\hat{u}|X]=0)$

---

# Sidenote: Statistical Estimators I

- In statistics, an .hi[estimator] is a rule for calculating a statistic (about a population parameter)

--

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]:
We want to estimate the average height (H) of U.S. adults (population) and have a random sample of 100 adults.]

--

- Calculate the mean height of our sample $(\bar{H})$ to estimate the true mean height of the population $(\mu_H)$

- $\bar{H}$ is an **estimator** of $\mu_H$

--

- There are many estimators we *could* use to estimate $\mu_H$
  - How about using the first value in our sample: $H_1$ ?

# Exogeneity and Unbiasedness II

- Recall, an .hi[exogenous] variable $(X)$ is unrelated to other factors affecting $Y$, i.e.:

$$cor(X,u)=0$$

--

- Again, this is called the **Zero Conditional Mean Assumption**

$$E(u|X)=0$$

--

- For any known value of $X$, the expected value of $u$ is 0

- Knowing the value of $X$ must tell us *nothing* about the value of $u$ (anything else relevant to $Y$ other than $X$)

- We can then confidently assert causation: $X \rightarrow Y$

---

# Endogeneity and Bias

- Nearly all independent variables are .hi[endogenous], they **are** related to the error term $u$
$$cor(X,u)\neq 0$$

--

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]: Suppose we estimate the following relationship:

$$\text{Violent crimes}_t=\beta_0+\beta_1\text{Ice cream sales}_t+u_t$$

- We find $\hat{\beta_1}>0$

- Does this mean Ice cream sales $\rightarrow$ Violent crimes?

# Endogeneity and Bias: Takeaways

$$E[\hat{\beta_1}]=\beta_1+cor(X,u)\frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_X}$$

]

.smallest[
1) If $X$ is exogenous: $cor(X,u)=0$, we're just left with $\beta_1$
]

--

.smallest[
2) The larger $cor(X,u)$ is, larger .hi-purple[bias]: $\left(E[\hat{\beta_1}]-\beta_1 \right)$
]

--

.smallest[
3) We can .hi-purple[“sign”] the direction of the bias based on $cor(X,u)$
  - .hi-purple[Positive] $cor(X,u)$ overestimates the true $\beta_1$ $(\hat{\beta_1}$ is too high)
  - .hi-purple[Negative] $cor(X,u)$ underestimates the true $\beta_1$ $(\hat{\beta_1}$ is too low)

# Endogeneity and Bias: Example I

$$wages_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 education_i+u$$
