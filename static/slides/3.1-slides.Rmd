# Recall: The Two Big Problems with Data

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- We use econometrics to .hi-purple[identify] causal relationships and make .hi-purple[inferences] about them

1. Problem for .hi-purple[identification]: .hi[endogeneity]
  - $X$ is **exogenous** if $cor(x, u) = 0$
  - $X$ is **endogenous** if $cor(x, u) \neq 0$

2. Problem for .hi-purple[inference]: .hi[randomness]
  - Data is random due to **natural sampling variation**
  - Taking one sample of a population will yield slightly different information than another sample of the same population

# Potential Outcomes

# The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

- Suppose we have some outcome variable $Y$

--

- Individuals $(i)$ face a choice between two outcomes (such as being .hi[treated] or .hi-purple[not treated]):
  - $\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}}$: outcome when individual $i$ is .hi-purple[not treated]
  - $\color{#e64173}{Y_i^{1}}$: outcome when individual $i$ is .hi[treated]

.center[
✨ $\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i} = \color{#e64173}{Y_i^{1}} - \color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}}$  ✨
]
]

- $\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i}$ is the .hi-slate[causal effect] of treatment on individual $i$

- .hi-purple[Individual counterfactuals do not exist (“the path not taken”)]

- You will always only ever get one of these per individual!
  - e.g. what would your life have been like if you did not go to Hood College?? 🧐

- So what can we do?

# The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

.bigger[
$$\color{#314f4f}{ATE} = \color{#e64173}{E[Y_i^{1}]} - \color{#6A5ACD}{E[Y_i^{0}]}$$
]

- Have large groups, and take *averages* instead!

- .hi-slate[Average Treatment Effect (ATE)]: difference in the average (expected value) of outcome $Y$ between treated individuals and untreated individuals
$$\color{#314f4f}{\delta} = \color{#e64173}{(\bar{Y}|D=1)}-\color{#6A5ACD}{(\bar{Y}|D=0)}$$

- $D_i$ is a .hi-turquoise[binary variable], $= \begin{cases} \color{#6A5ACD}{0} & \color{#6A5ACD}{\text{ if person is not treated}}\\\color{#e64173}{1} & \color{#e64173}{\text{ if person is treated}}\\ \end{cases}$
  - I’d much rather call this $T$, standing for $T$reatment, but this notation is famous

# The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

.bigger[
$$\color{#314f4f}{ATE} = \color{#e64173}{E[Y_i^{1}]} - \color{#6A5ACD}{E[Y_i^{0}]}$$
]

Again: 

- Either we observe individual $i$ in the .hi[treatment group] $\color{#e64173}{(D=1)}$, i.e.
$$\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i} = \color{#e64173}{Y_i^{1}} - \color{red}{?}$$

- Or we observe individual $i$ in the .hi-purple[control group] $\color{#6A5ACD}{(D=0)}$, i.e.
$$\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i} = \color{red}{?} - \color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}} $$

- Never both at the same time:

# Example: Thinking about the Data

.pull-left[

- Basic comparisons tell us *something* about outcomes, but not .hi-slate[ATE]

$$\text{Diff. in Group Outcomes} = \color{#314f4f}{ATE} + \color{#FFA500}{\text{Selection Bias}}$$

- .hi-orange[Selection bias]: difference in average $Y^0_i$ between groups pre-treatment

- $Y^0_i$ includes *everything* about person $i$ relevant to health *except* treatment (insurance) status
  - Age, sex, height, weight, climate, smoker, exercise, diet, etc. 
  - Imagine a world where *nobody* gets insurance (treatment), who would have highest health scores?

# Understanding Selection Bias

.pull-left[

- Consider the problem in regression form:

$Y = \beta_0+\beta_1 D_i + u_i$

- Where $D_i = \begin{cases} \color{#6A5ACD}{0} & \color{#6A5ACD}{\text{ if person is not treated}}\\\color{#e64173}{1} & \color{#e64173}{\text{ if person is treated}}\\ \end{cases}$

- The problem is $cor(D,u) \neq 0$!
  - *D* (Treatment) is endogenous!
  - *Getting* treatment is correlated with other factors!

# Random Assignment: The Silver Bullet

.pull-left[

- If treatment is .hi[randomly assigned] for a large sample, it eliminates selection bias!

- Treatment and control groups differ *on average* by nothing *except* treatment status

- Creates *ceterus paribus* conditions in economics: groups are identical *on average* (holding constant age, sex, height, etc.)

# Random Assignment: The Silver Bullet

- Consider the problem in regression form:

$Y = \beta_0+\beta_1 D_i + u_i$

- Some events beyond our control occur that separate *otherwise similar* entities into a "treatment" group and a "control" group that we can compare

# Famous Natural Experiments

- **Oregon Health Insurance Experiment**: Oregon used lottery to grant Medicare access to 10,000 people, showing access to Medicaid increased use of health services, lowered debt, etc. relative to those not on Medicaid
- **Angrist (1990)** finds that lifetime earnings of (random) drafted Vietnam veterans is 15% lower than non-veterans
- **Card & Kreuger (1994)** find that minimum wage hike in fast-food restaurants on NJ side of border had no disemployment effects relative to restaurants on PA side of border during the same period
- **Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001)** find that inclusive institutions lead to higher economic development than extractive institutions, determined by a colony's disease environment in 1500
- We will look at some of these in greater detail throughout the course
- [A great list, with explanations is here](http://economicspsychologypolicy.blogspot.com/2015/06/list-of-19-natural-experiments.html)

# RCTs and Evidence-Based Policy

- Programs *randomly* assign treatment to different individuals and measure causal effect of treatment

- Some do: 

- **RAND Health Insurance Study**: randomly give people health insurance

- **Oregon Medicaid Expansion**: randomly give people Medicaid

- **HUD's Moving to Opportunity**: randomly give people moving vouchers

- **Tennessee STAR**: randomly assign students to large vs. small classes

# RCTs and External Validity

- Even if a study is .hi-purple[internally valid] (used statistics correctly, etc.) we must still worry about .hi-purple[external validity]:
