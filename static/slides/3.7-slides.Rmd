# Three Types of Interactions

- Depending on the types of variables, there are 3 possible types of interaction effects

- We will look at each in turn

--

1. Interaction between a **dummy** and a **continuous** variable:
$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_i+\beta_2 D_i+\beta_3 \color{#e64173}{(X_i \times D_i)}$$
--

2. Interaction between a **two dummy** variables:
$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1D_{1i}+\beta_2 D_{2i}+\beta_3 \color{#e64173}{(D_{1i} \times D_{2i})}$$
--

3. Interaction between a **two continuous** variables:
$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_{1i}+\beta_2 X_{2i}+\beta_3 \color{#e64173}{(X_{1i} \times X_{2i})}$$

---

# Interactions Between a Dummy and Continuous Variable

# Interactions: A Dummy & Continuous Variable

.center[
![](../images/lightswitchesannotated.png)
]

--

- Does the marginal effect of the continuous variable on $Y$ change depending on whether the dummy is “on” or “off”?

---

# Interactions: A Dummy & Continuous Variable I

- We can model an interaction by introducing a variable that is an .hi[interaction term] capturing the interaction between two variables:

$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_i+\beta_2 D_i+\color{#e64173}{\beta_3(X_i \times D_i)} \quad \text{ where } D_i=\{0,1\}$$

--

- $\color{#e64173}{\beta_3}$ estimates the .hi[interaction effect] between $X_i$ and $D_i$ on $Y_i$

--

- What do the different coefficients $(\beta)$’s tell us? 
  - Again, think logically by examining each group $(D_i=0$ or $D_i=1)$

---

# Interaction Effects as Two Regressions I

$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_i+\beta_2 D_i+\beta_3 X_i \times D_i$$

--

- .red[When `\\(D_i=0\\)` (Control group):]

$$\begin{align*}
\hat{Y_i}&=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}X_i+\hat{\beta_2}(\color{red}{0})+\hat{\beta_3}X_i \times (\color{red}{0})\\
\hat{Y_i}& =\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}X_i\\
\end{align*}$$

--

- .blue[When `\\(D_i=1\\)` (Treatment group):]

$$\begin{align*}
\hat{Y_i}&=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}X_i+\hat{\beta_2}(\color{blue}{1})+\hat{\beta_3}X_i \times (\color{blue}{1})\\
\hat{Y_i}&= (\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_2})+(\hat{\beta_1}+\hat{\beta_3})X_i\\
\end{align*}$$

--

- So what we really have is *two* regression lines!

# Interpretting Coefficients I

$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_i+\beta_2 D_i+\beta_3 \color{#e64173}{(X_i \times D_i)}$$

- To interpret the coefficients, compare cases after changing $X$ by $\color{#e64173}{\Delta X}$:

--

$$Y_i+\color{#e64173}{\Delta Y_i}=\beta_0+\beta_1(X_i\color{#e64173}{+\Delta X_i})\beta_2D_i+\beta_3\big((X_i\color{#e64173}{+\Delta X_i})D_i\big)$$

--

- Subtracting these two equations, the difference is:

--

$$\begin{align*}
	\Delta Y_i &= \beta_1 \Delta X_i + \beta_3 D_i \Delta X_i\\
	\color{#6A5ACD}{\frac{\Delta Y_i}{\Delta X_i}} &\color{#6A5ACD}{= \beta_1+\beta_3 D_i}\\
\end{align*}$$

--

- .hi-purple[The effect of `\\(X \rightarrow Y\\)` depends on the value of `\\(D_i\\)`!]

- .hi[`\\(\beta_3\\)`: *increment* to the effect of `\\(X \rightarrow Y\\)` when `\\(D_i=1\\)` (vs. `\\(D_i=0\\)`)]

---

# Interpretting Coefficients II

$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_i+\beta_2 D_i+\beta_3 \color{#e64173}{(X_i \times D_i)}$$

- $\hat{\beta_0}$: $E[Y_i]$ for $X_i=0$ and $D_i=0$

--

- $\beta_1$: Marginal effect of $X_i \rightarrow Y_i$ for $D_i=0$

--

- $\beta_2$: Marginal effect on $Y_i$ of difference between $D_i=0$ and $D_i=1$

--

- $\beta_3$: The **difference** of the marginal effect of $X_i \rightarrow Y_i$ between $D_i=0$ and $D_i=1$

--

- This is a bit awkward, easier to think about the two regression lines:

# Interactions Between Two Continuous Variables

$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_{1i}+\beta_2 X_{2i}+\beta_3 \color{#e64173}{(X_{1i} \times X_{2i})}$$

--

- To interpret coefficients, compare changes after changing $\color{#e64173}{\Delta X_{1i}}$ (holding $X_2$ constant):

$$Y_i+\color{#e64173}{\Delta Y_i}=\beta_0+\beta_1(X_1+\color{#e64173}{\Delta X_{1i}})\beta_2X_{2i}+\beta_3((X_{1i}+\color{#e64173}{\Delta X_{1i}}) \times X_{2i})$$

--

- Take the difference to get:

--

$$\begin{align*}
\Delta Y_i &= \beta_1 \Delta X_{1i}+ \beta_3 X_{2i} \Delta X_{1i}\\
\color{#6A5ACD}{\frac{\Delta Y_i}{\Delta X_{1i}}} &= \color{#6A5ACD}{\beta_1+\beta_3 X_{2i}}\\ 	
\end{align*}$$

- Estimated effect of education on wages depends on the amount of experience (and vice versa)!

$$\frac{\Delta wage}{\Delta educ}=\hat{\beta_1}+\beta_3 \, exper_i$$

$$\frac{\Delta wage}{\Delta exper}=\hat{\beta_2}+\beta_3 \, educ_i$$
