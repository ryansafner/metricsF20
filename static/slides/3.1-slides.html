# Recall: The Two Big Problems with Data

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- We use econometrics to .hi-purple[identify] causal relationships and make .hi-purple[inferences] about them

1. Problem for .hi-purple[identification]: .hi[endogeneity]
  - `\(X\)` is **exogenous** if `\(cor(x, u) = 0\)`
  - `\(X\)` is **endogenous** if `\(cor(x, u) \neq 0\)`

2. Problem for .hi-purple[inference]: .hi[randomness]
  - Data is random due to **natural sampling variation**
  - Taking one sample of a population will yield slightly different information than another sample of the same population

# The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

- Suppose we have some outcome variable `\(Y\)`

--

- Individuals `\((i)\)` face a choice between two outcomes (such as being .hi[treated] or .hi-purple[not treated]):
  - `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}}\)`: outcome when individual `\(i\)` is .hi-purple[not treated]
  - `\(\color{#e64173}{Y_i^{1}}\)`: outcome when individual `\(i\)` is .hi[treated]

- `\(\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i}\)` is the .hi-slate[causal effect] of treatment on individual `\(i\)`

- .hi-purple[Individual counterfactuals do not exist (‚Äúthe path not taken‚Äù)]

- You will always only ever get one of these per individual!
  - e.g. what would your life have been like if you did not go to Hood College?? üßê

- So what can we do?

# The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

.bigger[
`$$\color{#314f4f}{ATE} = \color{#e64173}{E[Y_i^{1}]} - \color{#6A5ACD}{E[Y_i^{0}]}$$`
]

- Have large groups, and take *averages* instead!

- .hi-slate[Average Treatment Effect (ATE)]: difference in the average (expected value) of outcome `\(Y\)` between treated individuals and untreated individuals
`$$\color{#314f4f}{\delta} = \color{#e64173}{(\bar{Y}|D=1)}-\color{#6A5ACD}{(\bar{Y}|D=0)}$$`

- `\(D_i\)` is a .hi-turquoise[binary variable], `\(= \begin{cases} \color{#6A5ACD}{0} &amp; \color{#6A5ACD}{\text{ if person is not treated}}\\\color{#e64173}{1} &amp; \color{#e64173}{\text{ if person is treated}}\\ \end{cases}\)`
  - I‚Äôd much rather call this `\(T\)`, standing for `\(T\)`reatment, but this notation is famous

---

# The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

.bigger[
`$$\color{#314f4f}{ATE} = \color{#e64173}{E[Y_i^{1}]} - \color{#6A5ACD}{E[Y_i^{0}]}$$`
]

Again: 

- Either we observe individual `\(i\)` in the .hi[treatment group] `\(\color{#e64173}{(D=1)}\)`, i.e.
`$$\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i} = \color{#e64173}{Y_i^{1}} - \color{red}{?}$$`

- Or we observe individual `\(i\)` in the .hi-purple[control group] `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{(D=0)}\)`, i.e.
$$\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i} = \color{red}{?} - \color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}} $$

- Never both at the same time:

# Understanding Selection Bias

- Consider the problem in regression form:

`\(Y = \beta_0+\beta_1 D_i + u_i\)`

- Where `\(D_i = \begin{cases} \color{#6A5ACD}{0} &amp; \color{#6A5ACD}{\text{ if person is not treated}}\\\color{#e64173}{1} &amp; \color{#e64173}{\text{ if person is treated}}\\ \end{cases}\)`

- The problem is `\(cor(D,u) \neq 0\)`!
  - *D* (Treatment) is endogenous!
  - *Getting* treatment is correlated with other factors!

# Random Assignment: The Silver Bullet

.pull-left[

- If treatment is .hi[randomly assigned] for a large sample, it eliminates selection bias!

- Treatment and control groups differ *on average* by nothing *except* treatment status

- Creates *ceterus paribus* conditions in economics: groups are identical *on average* (holding constant age, sex, height, etc.)

# Random Assignment: The Silver Bullet

- Consider the problem in regression form:

`\(Y = \beta_0+\beta_1 D_i + u_i\)`

- If treatment `\(D_i\)` is administered *randomly*, it breaks the correlation with `\(u_i\)`!

# Famous Natural Experiments

- **Oregon Health Insurance Experiment**: Oregon used lottery to grant Medicare access to 10,000 people, showing access to Medicaid increased use of health services, lowered debt, etc. relative to those not on Medicaid
- **Angrist (1990)** finds that lifetime earnings of (random) drafted Vietnam veterans is 15% lower than non-veterans
- **Card &amp; Kreuger (1994)** find that minimum wage hike in fast-food restaurants on NJ side of border had no disemployment effects relative to restaurants on PA side of border during the same period
- **Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001)** find that inclusive institutions lead to higher economic development than extractive institutions, determined by a colony's disease environment in 1500
- We will look at some of these in greater detail throughout the course
- [A great list, with explanations is here](http://economicspsychologypolicy.blogspot.com/2015/06/list-of-19-natural-experiments.html)

&gt; The RCT is a useful tool, but I think that is a mistake to put method ahead of substance. I have written papers using RCTs. Like other methods of investigation, they are often useful, and, like other methods, they have dangers and drawbacks. Methodological prejudice can only tie our hands...**It is not true that an RCT, when feasible, will always do better than an observational study.** This should not be controversial [but] might still make some uncomfortable, particularly the second [statement]: (a) RCTs are affected by the same problems of inference and estimation that economists have faced using other methods, and (b) no RCT can ever legitimately claim to have established causality. **My theme is that RCTs have no special status, they have no exemption from the problems of inference that econometricians have always wrestled with, and there is nothing that they, and only they, can accomplish.**

&gt; People keep saying that the recent Nobelists "studied global poverty." This is exactly wrong. They made a commitment to a method, not a subject, and their commitment to method prevented them from studying global poverty.

&gt; At a conference at Brookings in 2008 Paul Romer (last years Nobelist) said: "You guys are like going to a doctor who says you have an allergy and you have cancer. With the skin rash we can divide you skin into areas and test variety of substances and identify with precision and some certainty the cause. Cancer we have some ideas how to treat it but there are a variety of approaches and since we cannot be sure and precise about which is best for you, we will ignore the cancer and not treat it."
