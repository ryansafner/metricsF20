# Strongly Recommended

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Math and Probability Background Appendix A in Bailey

Now that we return to the statistics, we will do a minimal overview of basic statistics and distributions. Review Bailey's appendices. Today, only A is really useful, the rest will come next class.

Chapter 2 is optional, but will give you a good overview of using data.
