<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>This assignment is <strong>UNGRADED</strong>, and only intended for assisting you in studying for the final exam. It also provides examples of how to work with panel data models in <code>R</code>.</p>
<h2 id="theory-and-concepts">Theory and Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="question-1">Question 1</h3>
<p>In your own words, describe what <em>fixed effects</em> are, when we can use them, and how they remove endogeneity.</p>
<h3 id="question-2">Question 2</h3>
<p>In your own words, describe the logic of a <em>difference-in-difference</em> model: what is it comparing against what, and how does it estimate the effect of treatment? What assumption must be made about the treatment and control group for the model to be valid?</p>
<h2 id="r-questions">R Questions</h2>
<p>Answer the following questions using <code>R</code>. When necessary, please write answers in the same document (knitted <code>Rmd</code> to <code>html</code> or <code>pdf</code>, typed <code>.doc(x)</code>, or handwritten) as your answers to the above questions. Be sure to include (email or print an <code>.R</code> file, or show in your knitted <code>markdown</code>) your code and the outputs of your code with the rest of your answers.</p>

<p>How do people respond to changes in economic conditions? Are they more likely to pursue public service when private sector jobs are scarce? This dataset contains variables at the U.S. State (&amp; D.C.) level:</p>

<h4 id="part-b">Part B</h4>
<p>To get the hang of the data we’re working with, <code>count</code> (separately) the number of <code>state</code>s, and the number of <code>year</code>s.

<h4 id="part-d">Part D</h4>
<p>Create a scatterplot of <code>appspc</code> (Y) on <code>unemployrate</code> (X). Which State is an outlier? How would this affect the pooled regression estimates? Create a <em>second</em> scatterplot that does not include this State.</p>
<h4 id="part-e">Part E</h4>
<p>Run two <em>pooled</em> regressions, one with the outliers, and one without them. Write out the estimated regression equation for each. Interpret the coefficient, and comment on how it changes between the two regressions.</p>
<h4 id="part-f">Part F</h4>
<p>Now run a regression with State fixed effects using the dummy variable method.<span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ensure that <code>state</code> is a factor variable, and insert in the regression.

<h3 id="question-4">Question 4</h3>

<li><a href="http://metricsf20.classes.ryansafner.com/data/TexasSchools.csv"><i class="fas fa-table"></i> <code>TexasSchools.csv</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Are teachers paid more when school board members are elected “off cycle” when there are not major national political elections (e.g. odd years) than “on cycle?” The argument is that during “off” years, without attention on state or national elections, voters will pay less attention to the election, and teachers can more effectively mobilize for higher pay, versus “on” years where voters are paying more attention. This data comes from Anzia, Sarah (2012), “The Election Timing Effect: Evidence from a Policy Intervention in Texas.” <em>Quarterly Journal of Political Science</em> 7(3): 277-297, and follows 1,020 Texas school board districts from 2003–2009.</p>
<p>From 2003–2006, all districts elected their school board members off-cycle. A change in Texas policy in 2006 led some, but not all, districts to elect their school board members on-cycle from 2007 onwards.</p>

<h4 id="part-a-1">Part A</h4>
<p>Run a pooled regression model of <code>LnAvgSalary</code> on <code>OnCycle</code>. Write the estimated regression equation, and interpret the coefficient on <code>OnCycle.</code> Are there any sources of bias (consider in particular the argument in the question prompt)?</p>
<h4 id="part-b-1">Part B</h4>
<p>Some schools decided to switch to an on-cycle election after 2006. Consider this, <code>CycleSwitch</code> the “treatment.” Create a variable to indicate post-treatment years (i.e. years after 2006). Call it <code>After</code>.</p>
<h4 id="part-c-1">Part C</h4>
<p>Now estimate a difference-in-difference model with your variables in Part B: <code>CycleSwitch</code> is the treatment variable, <code>After</code> is your post-treatment indicator, and add an <em>interaction</em> variable to capture the interaction effect between those districts that <em>switched</em>, and <em>after</em> the treatment. Write down the estimated regression equation (to four decimal places).</p>
<h4 id="part-d-1">Part D</h4>
<p>Interpret what each coefficient means from Part C.</p>
<h4 id="part-e-1">Part E</h4>
<p>Using your regression equation in Part C, calculate the expected logged average salary <span class="math inline">\((Y)\)</span> for districts in Texas:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><em>Before</em> the switch that did <em>not</em> switch</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><em>After</em> the switch that did <em>not</em> switch</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><em>Before</em> the switch that <em>did</em> switch</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><em>After</em> the switch that <em>did</em> switch</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="part-f-1">Part F</h4>
<p>Confirm your estimates in Part E by finding the mean logged average salary for each of those four groups in the data.<span><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Hint, <code>filter()</code> properly then <code>summarize()</code>.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<h4 id="part-g-1">Part G</h4>
<p>Write out the difference-in-difference equation, and calculate the difference-in-difference. Make sure it matches your estimate from the regression.</p>
<h4 id="part-h-1">Part H</h4>
<p>Can we say anything about the types of districts that switched? Can we say anything about all salaries in the districts in the years after the switch?</p>
<h4 id="part-i-1">Part I</h4>
<p>Now let’s generalize the diff-in-diff model. Instead of the treatment and post- treatment dummies, use district- and year-fixed effects and the interaction term. Interpret the coefficient on the interaction term.</p>
<h4 id="part-j-1">Part J</h4>
<p>Create a nice regression table (using <code>huxtable</code>) for comparison of the regressions in (a), (c), and (i).</p>
