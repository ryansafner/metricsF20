<p><strong>Exam 1 will be available 5:00 PM Tuesday, September 29 through 10:00 PM Sunday October 4 on Blackboard</strong><span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Go to our class Blackboard page, on the blue navigation bar on the left, click Assignments, you will find Exam 1.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>If you have any approved testing accomodations, please let me know ASAP and we will make arrangements. Given the time you have to complete the exam, I will not look favorably on excuses given on Sunday.</p>
<p>While the exam is out, I (or our TA) will not answer any questions related to 1.1-2.7 content at Office Hours, by email, or Slack. We can, of course, still discuss other things. If you have questions, please discuss them with me before 5 PM Tuesday Sept 29!</p>
<h2 id="exam-instructions-important-please-read">Exam Instructions (<i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Important, Please read)</h2>
<p>This test will be available on Blackboard as a <em>timed</em> assignment. You will have <strong>2 hours once you open the test on Blackboard</strong>. You will <em>not</em> need the whole time, I have given you some extra to accomodate the technical difficulties of taking an exam at home. <strong>Please pick a time to take it where you know you will have 2 hours</strong>. You may close the exam page and come back to it, but <em>the timer will continue to run</em> once the exam is first opened.</p>
<p>You must show all of your work (for calculation problems), either by typing your steps into the answer form, or you may upload (or as a <em>last</em> resort (please!), email me them before your time runs out), handwritten steps to the exam, solving your problems.</p>
<p>This is an <strong>open note, open book</strong> exam, but <strong>do not use the internet beyond our class website, or contact each other</strong><span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Google won’t help you here. Everything you need should be in your notes, homeworks, or slides anyway!<br />
<br />
</span></span> I will automatically interpret substantially-similarly-written answers, obviously-googled answers, and messaging between students as cheating or plagiarism, respectively. Either will earn you a 0, and be reported. Answers should be <em>in your own words</em>, I will also deduct points for blatant copy-pastes off my slides (those are <em>my</em> words, not yours!).</p>
<p><strong>There will be no use of R on the exam</strong>. However, you <em>should</em> be familiar with certain outputs of R that I can ask you questions about (such as regression output from <code>lm()</code>, <code>tidy()</code>, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>There will be few, if any, calculation questions</strong>. Questions are more about <em>interpretation</em> of concepts and interpretting numbers in the context of various regressions and research questions.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>practice exam</strong> on Blackboard that <strong>I would like you to take</strong>, so you can see what the exam will look like, and to make sure you can access and complete it. <strong>Please try this before Sunday September 27 and email me if you ran into any issues.</strong> This is to help make sure this format works for everyone.</p>

<p>Make sure you do all of the homework problems and learn from the answer keys to the homeworks, as well as the in-class practice problems. While some of the questions should be novel applications, conceptual questions on homeworks will get you in the right headspace to think about answering a question on an exam.</p>
