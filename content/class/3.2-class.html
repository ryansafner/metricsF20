<p><em>Thursday, October 8, 2020</em></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Today we return to a more nuanced discussion of causality, given what we have learned about the fundamental problem of causal inference (counterfactuals and potential outcomes). RCTs are great, but they are not everything — and in any case, you are never going to be able to design and run an RCT in the overwhelming majority of studies.</p>
<p>Now that we understand counterfactuals, we can apply our idea of exogeneity to argue that indeed, yes, <strong>correlation <em>does</em> imply causation</strong> when <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is exogenous! That is, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> being correlated with <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> <em>implies</em> there is a causal connection between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and if we are certain that <span class="math inline">\(cor(X,u)=0\)</span>, then we are clearly measuring the causal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span>! If <span class="math inline">\(cor(X,u) \neq 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is endogenous, there is <em>still</em> a causal connection between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, but it goes through other variables that jointly cause <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>We also introduce a new tool for thinking about simple causal models, the <strong>directed acyclic graph (DAG)</strong>. These are a hip new trend for thinking about causal inference, so new and trendy that they aren’t really in any mainstream textbooks yet!</p>
<p>DAGS and DAG rules (front doors, back doors, colliders, mediators, etc.) will allow you to visually map the causal relationships between variables and describe to you the variables you must <strong>control for</strong> in order to properly <strong>identify the causal effect</strong> you are trying to measure. I show you a simply tool, <a href="https://dagitty.net">daggity.net</a> that will help you do this, as well as <code>ggdag</code> in <code>R</code>.</p>
<h2 id="readings">Readings</h2>
<p>Please see <a href="/reading/3.2-reading">today’s suggested readings</a>. There are a number of useful readings (in addition to your textbook) that can help you understand the material for today.</p>
<h2 id="slides">Slides</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/slides/3.2-slides.html"><i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> View Lecture Slides</a></li>
<li><a href="/slides/3.2-slides.pdf"><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> Download as PDF</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-packages-mentioned">New Packages Mentioned</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>dagitty.net</code>: not a package in R, but an online tool to help you work with DAGs (see the cheat sheets in today’s readings page)</p></li>
<li><p><code>ggdag</code>: for drawing DAGs in ggplot, and for identifying pathways <code>ggdag_paths()</code> and required adjustments <code>ggdag_adjustment_set()</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practice">Practice</h2>
<p>See today’s <a href="/r/3.2-r/practice">practice problems</a> to help you use DAGs and daggity.net. Answers are be posted on that page.</p>
<h2 id="live-class-session-on-zoom">Live Class Session on Zoom</h2>
<p>The live class <i class="fas fa-video"></i> Zoom meeting link can be found on Blackboard (see <code>LIVE ZOOM MEETINGS</code> on the left navigation menu), starting at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>If you are unable to join today’s live session, or if you want to review, you can find the recording stored on Blackboard via Panopto (see <code>Class Recordings</code> on the left navigation menu).</p>
