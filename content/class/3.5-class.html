<p><em>Thursday, October 22, 2020</em></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Today we discuss the elements of a good empirical paper, with an eye towards your <a href="/assignment/paper-project">paper projects</a>.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you look at my example repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryansafner/workflow"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Workflow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryansafner/example_empirical_paper"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Example Empirical Paper</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The first is one that I showed you back in <a href="/class/1.5-class">class 1.5</a> when we talked about R Markdown and having a reproducible, plain-text, workflow. It has an example workflow setup that I recommend you follow: create an R project for your project, and organize all of your data, code, images, &amp; text in this set of folders inside of your project.<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I also recommend you at least save this folder on Dropbox to keep it safe!<br />
<br />
</span></span> You can look at <code>Example_paper.Rmd</code> to see my text and code in R markdown to write the paper, and look at <code>Example_paper.pdf</code> to see the final product.</p>
<p>The second is a quick and dirty example of what I am looking for in your paper project in this class, using the ongoing example of the effect of class size on test scores. You can also look at <code>paper.Rmd</code> to see my text and code in R markdown, and <code>paper.pdf</code> to see the final product. Note that this is an example I put quickly together with minimal effort as an example for you all, it does <em>not</em> necessarily mean it is an “A” quality paper!</p>
<p>If you are using R markdown to write your final paper, you should consult <a href="/class/1.5-class">class 1.5</a> again, along with the <a href="/class/1.5-r-practice">1.5 “practice”</a> that deals with the workflow repository.</p>

<p><a href="/assignment/04-problem-set">Problem Set 4</a> is due by 11:59PM on Sunday, October 25 by PDF upload to Blackboard.</p>
<h2 id="live-class-session-on-zoom">Live Class Session on Zoom</h2>
<p>The live class <i class="fas fa-video"></i> Zoom meeting link can be found on Blackboard (see <code>LIVE ZOOM MEETINGS</code> on the left navigation menu), starting at 11:30 AM.</p>
