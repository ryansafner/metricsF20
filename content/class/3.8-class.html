<p><em>Tuesday, November 3, 2020</em></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This week we will cover non-linear models, which we anticipated last week with an interaction effect between two continuous variables: <span class="math inline">\(X_1 \times X_2\)</span>, where the marginal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X_1 \rightarrow Y\)</span> is dependent on the value of <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We cover two types of nonlinear models. <em>Today</em>, we cover <strong>polynomial models</strong>, where we include higher-order <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> variables to explain a non-linear effect. <em>Next</em> class we will cover <strong>logarithmic models</strong>, which are more frequently used — as well as a few final tests and transformations for multivariate regression before we turn to panel data (Unit IV) next week.</p>
<p>Today, we will spend the first half of class finishing <a href="/r/3.7-r-practice">last class’ practice problems</a> (on dummy variables and interaction effects), then I will cover polynomial models. After we finish next class’ lecture, we will do another set of R practice problems, and you will be given your final graded <strong>HW 5</strong> to work on this material.</p>

<h2 id="practice-problems">Practice Problems</h2>
<p>Today I will give you some time to work on last class’ <a href="/r/3.7-r-practice">practice problems</a> (on dummies and interaction effects). Answers will be posted on that page later.</p>

<p><a href="/assignment/05-problem-set">Homework 5</a> (on 3.1-3.5) is due by 11:59 PM Sunday November 8. <strong>This is likely your final graded homework</strong><span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In the past, I have always released a HW 6 on Imperfect Competition just for practice for the Final Exam.<br />

<p>The live class <i class="fas fa-video"></i> Zoom meeting link can be found on Blackboard (see <code>LIVE ZOOM MEETINGS</code> on the left navigation menu), starting at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>If you are unable to join today’s live session, or if you want to review, you can find the recording stored on Blackboard via Panopto (see <code>Class Recordings</code> on the left navigation menu).</p>
